## Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD

This project sets up an AWS infrastructure using Terraform, with CI/CD integration in GitLab. The setup includes validation, deployment of infrastructure, deployment of Lambda functions, and conditional destruction of infrastructure based on environment variables.

### Part 1: Bash Script

#### Objective

Create a Bash script that performs validations and specific actions based on environment variables in GitLab.

#### Requirements

- The script must:
  - Check if a variable in GitLab called `DESTROY_INFRA` exists to determine if a `terraform destroy` command should be executed.
  - If `DESTROY_INFRA` is set to `true`, execute the `terraform destroy` command.
  - If `DESTROY_INFRA` is set to `false` or does not exist, do not execute the `terraform destroy` command.
  - Document the script and explain how to integrate it into the GitLab pipeline.

#### Script

Create a file named `terraform_destroy.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Verificar si la variable DESTROY_INFRA estÃ¡ establecida
if [ "$DESTROY_INFRA" == "true" ]; then
  echo "DESTROY_INFRA is set to true. Running 'terraform destroy'..."
  terraform destroy -auto-approve
else
  echo "DESTROY_INFRA is not set to true o not exists.'."
fi
